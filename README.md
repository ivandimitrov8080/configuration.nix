# NixOS configurations

This repository aims to help configure everything I use for all my machines.

### Features

- Defines default values for common utilities aimed at a smoother integration with the rest of the system and a shorter
  config.
- The module `meta` abstracts away common use cases where you want to enable more than one thing to achieve your goal.

### Goals

- Provide me with something that I personally can use.
- Make it modular so that it can be reused by other people or me on other people's machines.

### How to use

Check [examples](./examples) folder.

Run the following for more info:
```bash
